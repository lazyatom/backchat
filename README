Backchat
========

Basically a simple server to embed comments on other websites. Like, say, Trac. You can think of it a bit like Hoodwink'd, except these comments can be private, and therefore contain sensitive information.


Usage
-----

You'll need a few gems first:

  $ gem install merb-core bluecloth markaby activerecord

Run the server:

  $ cd backchat
  $ merb -I backchat.rb


Then embed the javascript in a page or template:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://your-server:4000/<reference>.js"></script>

Where <reference> is something unique, like a trac changeset number.


TODO
----

* A better way of embedding the HTML than document.write might be nice - the way I'm doing it right now is incredibly flaky
* Determine the reference automatically from the URL
* Some kind of bookmarklet
