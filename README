Backchat
========

Basically a simple server to embed comments on other websites. Like, say, Trac. You can think of it a bit like Hoodwink'd, except these comments can be private, and therefore contain sensitive information.


Usage
-----

Run the server:

  $ ruby backchat.rb


Then embed the javascript in a page or template:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://your-server:4576/<reference>.js"></script>

Where <reference> is something uniq.


Todo
----

Determine the reference automatically
Redirect back to the originating page when posting
